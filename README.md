I orginally made a LST project for a client using Solana native, however I wanted to try it out in Anchor as well. (https://github.com/btorressz/LST)

# LST Program: Liquid Staking Token(lst_program)

This **LST Program** is a Solana Program (smart contract) designed to facilitate liquid staking on the Solana blockchain. Users can stake their SOL tokens and receive **Liquidity Staking Tokens (LST)** as proof of their stake. LST tokens are fungible and can be utilized across the Solana ecosystem while users continue earning staking rewards.

## Overview

The program supports:
- **Liquid Staking**: Stake SOL and receive LST tokens for liquidity.
- **Withdrawals**: Redeem LST tokens to withdraw SOL.
- **Compounding Rewards**: Automatically compound rewards for the pool.
- **Admin Controls**: Manage fees, redelegate stakes, and control program states.
